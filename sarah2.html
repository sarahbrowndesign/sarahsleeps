    <h1>8/22/22</h1>
    Today is August 22nd, 2022. I am laying in my bed typing while my laptop burns a hole in my comforter probably from being so overheated. I hate this piece of shit laptop. It's 8;32pm and I am procrastinating finishing packing. 
    I'm going to Punta Cana tomorrow with Griffin. He is at the Yankees game with his family right now and he's going to pick me up after so we can sleep at his house tonight and wake up tomorrow at like 4;00am for the airport. His dad is driving us. 
    I am really excited. We are going for 6 nights. I have never been on a real vacation with a guy other than Shane. Most of those vacations were 3-4 day trips within the country where we fought a lot and were constantly moving around. It will be exciting to relax. Griffin is a nice guy, I feel like he deserves a good girl who will not hurt him the way I inevitably will.
     I originally felt guilty over hurting Kris and ruining their friendship. 
    Then, between Kris being a pussy in the way he handled it paired with my girlfriends fueling the fire,
     I wrote him off as a fuck you I'll do what I want and I stopped feeling bad. 
     But then the other day, maybe I'm just PMSing, but I was going through old pictures and texts and my memory box and I found all the sweet things Kris wrote me and I felt bad.
      I do not miss Kris nor do I have any sort of romantic attachment to him or want his attention, which is rare for me. But I feel bad, because he is a real genuine guy and he loved me so well. He gave me his heart and soul and put so much effort in to us from day one. I really thought back then that we would end up getting married. To think that two years later I am practically dating one of his best friends, I feel like a scumbag. 
      Griffin is really the most at fault here, not to take all the blame off of myself, but at the end of the day he sacrificed his entire friendship and reliability in his friend group for me. And I don't even know how I feel about him. It feels like a huge burden on me. I didn't ask him to do all that for me.
       Even though I egged him on to flirting and hooking up I really didn't want him to isolate himself for me. Now he is incorporated into my friend group, comfortable around my family, and going on a 6 day vacation with me. And then after all of that I will come back, go back to rutgers, and he will be alone here.
        He still has his friends but things are weird between him and them now. I feel guilty. I feel guilty for basically having a whole other boyfriend waiting for me at school. I like Jon and Griffin but neither of them enough to be in a relationship with.
         I find myself constantly hiding my phone and turning their contacts on do not disturb, I feel the same way I did when I would hide Matt Gervo from Shane last year. 
         It feels like I am really unable to be alone but also completely inable to cimmit to anyone. I worry so heavy that I won't be able to ever be satisfied with one person. 
         And after all this the pain I feel from Shane is still there. I am pleasantly surprised at how I have been able to go now almost 3 weeks without texting him, but I feel guilty for now messing up Griffin and Jon's lives while holding on to those feelings for Shane still. 
         Granted, Griffin knew I was still seeing Shane. Hell, he MET shane at midland. The last time I ever saw Shane, that night with the slipknot concert, I had woken up at Griffins house that morning and went home 4 hours before Shane arrived. 
The night before was the first time me and griffin had ever had sex. I didn't really have any healing time. Almost immediately after, Griffin and I were in full force. 
I always do that. Distract myself from the pain by rebounding. And I end up hurting other people. I hurt myself to, but I never hurt as bad as them. I just hate being alone but I hate being tied down. I am only 22, but how long can I use the "I'm young" excuse you know? At the end of the day,
I feel like Shane and I aren't over. Maybe we really are, and it's just the fact that I'm so used to going back to him that makes me feel like I will again. It's a routine. I'm pretty sure he's fully dating Riley now. I'm actually pretty sure he was fully dating her when I was still seeing her. 
And he gaslit (ew) me into apologizing for being mad about it. I remember telling my friends saying guys he loves me it doesn't matter if he's seeing her cause im seeing other guys,
he's not telling her the same things as me yada yada, now looking back i feel so fucking stupid. And I did it to myself. I still can't decide if he treated me good or poorly. I think both. The weirdest 
part of it all is how the lovebombing was so addicting. That's what I crave from Griffin and Jon. But it's unhealthy and absurd to expect someone to devote their every thought and movement to me without committing to them. 
I just need someone to be obsessed with me as much as I am obsessed with myself. I need someone to feel like if I left them they would stop breathing. And I know it is unhealthy. I miss it so much. I miss how Shane used to literally worship my body,
we had really good sex. I was the only girl in the entire world. Nobody was as hot or sexy or beautiful or sweet or funny or important as me when I was with him. I still can't find him unappetizing. I miss his soft skin and tattoos and his fingers and how he smelled like croissants? I love croissants. I miss how he was so "get it done". I never 
lifted a finger with him. He spent so much money and time and energy on me. I was his entire world. 
Anyways let me stop and go pack. Ughh I'm so excited but I'm nervous. It feels weird to be going on vacation and know I won't be yelled at or shamed for something I didn't do or deserve. Griffins a good guy.

I think I'm going to use this as a diary instead of my written one because i find it hard to write manually for such a long time. I get lazy and my hand hurts and my handwriting is so sloppy. this isnt as charming as a diary, but it's much more organized and less time consuming. I just wrote all of this in less than fifteen minutes perhaps.
