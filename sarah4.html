    School Started
    The first week went how it normally did, I was really overwhemled and scared and feeling hopeless and lazy. My schedule was utterly insane but thank god I figured out that I didn't have to take that additional studio course. 
    My schedule is way more manageable now. I like all of my classes and I'm excited for thesis. Last night was my first 
    football Sunday at Hooters. I made almost $400. One guy tipped me $100 on a $107 tab and my last guy tipped me $120 on a $30 tab. Unreal 
    money these men spend. Today I had photo 1A. My professor is really cool. Melissa and I thought we were going to have this class together but we don't which is a bummer. The class seems easy but fun. The professor is a young girl
    who is really awesome and insightful. She shared an EE Cummings poem for us which made me happy because he wrote my favorite poem "Somewhere I have never travelled, gladly beyond." Today she said something that kind of stuck with me. She was basically saying that individuality and being your own person isn't about isolation and superiority but about being your own person in solidarity with every other own person. I definitely didn't describe it as good as she did but I like that. I think there's something in all of us that wants to be better than everyone else, but that seems kind of cold and isolating. I was 
    talking about that recently with Giselle and Thea and Abby and Griffin and Nicole I think. When we were pregmaing for Midland. Someone was saying how it's wrong for celebrities to complain, which yeah it's in poor taste sometimes but 
    I don't think I would ever want to be Kylie Jenner level famous. You can't go anywhere or have a normal life or enjoy something as simple as going for a walk. That sounds so shitty. And how can you even fully enjoy all that money with everyone
    breathing down your neck and judging you for everything. I don't feel fully comfortable at the house yet. I like my roommates, but I miss my girlfriends at home. I don't really feel like I am aiming to create life long bonds with these girls, which is probably mean or careless of me. I'm kind of just focusing on graduating and getting the fuck out of here. I don't really feel like going to the bars 
    here anymore. I feel a lot older than everyone else even though I'm not. Last year, I would have never missed a Tuesday and now I don't even think I'm going to go out tomorrow. I miss Griffin.
