    <h1>8/31/22</h1>

    Today is Wednesday and its 3;12pm. I just got back from going to 
    five below because I needed a new car phone mount and I got perfume
     and a little journal for my purse too. I got back from Punta Cana 
     with Griffin on Monday. Overall, it was a good vacation. I was pretty 
     nervous that it would go wrong because I'm just so used to it with Shane.
      Like I wasn't worried that we'd fight or he'd turn abusive or something,
       moreso just worried it would be awkward or uncomfortable or we would get
        sick of each other. But it didn't happen. We literally spent every single
         second of the 7 days together besides 1. shitting and 2. the one hour on 
         Friday where I facetimed Todd he went down to the pool alone. Besides
          that, we showered together and were in the same room when each other
           was peeing. I didn't get sick of it though surprisingly and I didn't
            wish that I was alone. There were a few moments where I wished that
             my girlfriends were there or that I missed Jon, especially during 
             sex, but that was it. Our sex was significantly better there, still 
             not amazing, but pretty good. He doesn't really know what he's doing 
             and he is so quiet. Talking during sex is like the most important
              part to me and he is pretty much dead silent besides short answers 
              when I speak during. My friends think I should bring it up to him
               but to me part of the fun of it is the words naturally coming out
                and I feel like he's awkward and it would feel cringey or forced 
                if I told him to do it. That's why I try to like coax him to do
                 it by initiating conversation but he doesn't really carry it out.
                  I definitely like him a lot more after this trip. There were some
                   moments were I was absolutely infatuated with him and it felt like 
                   I liked him more than he liked me, which is really rare for me. But
                    again, my feelings are so fleeting and on and off that it would 
                    really just come and go. By the end I was ready to go home,
     but not because I was sick of him but because I was sick of the 
     resort. The food sucked and there wasn't much to do there besides 
     lay by the pool or beach and drink all day. Which would normally
      be my dream come true but I felt like fucking shit the last few 
      days we were there. I miss writing and I miss reading and I feel 
      like I haven't made art or any sort of progress in myself in a long 
      time. This summer break was really long even though it went by fast I 
      feel like the entire time all I focused on was my appearance and my 
      social life, which is good I guess. I have a lot of confidence, maybe
       too much confidence, and I have a lot of friends, maybe too many 
       friends. I shouldn't feel this way but I do, I'm worried I don't 
       have the social battery to now create and maintain friendships 
       with my 8 roommmates. Sophie and I are already really close and 
       I love her and it feels natural and I'm over the moon about it.
        But everybody else, especially the younger girls, I don't know 
        why I'm not as excited as I was before about having new friends.
         I think it's because after spending all summer with my friends 
         that I don't want to leave them so badly that I don't care about
          making new ones. I am happy to not have to worry about going out
           and finding friends after all my old ones graduated though. I'm 
           worried that I won't have anybody to go crazy partying with. I'm 
           so used to going out 4-5 days a week especially in the beginning 
           that now I'm worried that I won't have people who are equally as 
           social and crazy as me. I know Sophie wants to but she has really 
           bad social anxiety and her social battery probably will run out a 
           lot faster than mine. Another thing I'm worried about is Griffin. 
           Because I know I'm going to miss him but I also know that when I 
           get back to school I'm going to be so busy with school and work
            and seeing my friends and partying and seeing Jon that it will 
            be easy for me to distract myself and not feel the need to see him every
      weekend. I don't want him to feel like I'm dropping him. Like he
       is so used to having me nearly every night and me being pretty 
       much his girlfriend and that's all going to disappear. He told 
       me he was used to being long distance and seeing Julia once a 
       month so that makes me feel better but I also reiterated to him
        that I do not want to be exclusive which he agreed with but I
         also feel anxiety about that because even though we had that 
         conversation , me and shane also agreed on that and we see 
         how that went. I have to keep reminding myself that he's not
          shane. He does things for me, he's so sweet, and he's handsome
           and cute and funny and gets along with my friends and I'm not
            embarrassed by him like I was with Shane. But he's also not 
            drop dead obsessed with me, worshipping me and lovebombing me
             like Shane was, which is probably a good thing but I miss it.
              I miss having someone basically kissing the ground I walk on
               which is definitely extremely self centered but I am obsessed
                with myself and I want someone else to be too. I think he is
                 obsessed with me a little bit but he doesn't show things as
                  much as other people do. Tonight, I'm going to Viva Margarita
                   in Hackensack with amy abby thea nicole and giselle. Griffin 
                   is going to be our DD which is sweet and I'm excited. I
                    have more internship stuff to do that I keep procrastinating
                     and it's making me anxious.
